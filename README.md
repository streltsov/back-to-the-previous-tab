# Back To The Previous Tab

This extension gives you a handy way to switch back to the tab you were
just looking at. Just hit Ctrl+6 (the one with the caret!) and you are right
back on your previous tab.

## Use case

Think of it this way - imagine you're reading an article in a foreign language
on Tab A and using a dictionary on Tab B. This extension allows you to easily
toggle back and forth between the two tabs.
