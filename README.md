# Back To The Previous Tab

This extension gives you a handy way to switch back to the tab you were just
looking at. Just hit **Ctrl+6** (the one with the caret!) and you are right
back on your previous tab.

## Use cases

1. Think of it this way - you've got numerous tabs open for different tasks and
   you switch to a pinned tab to check an email or you followed some
   notification. After checking the email or notification, you can't find the
   tab you were on before. Sounds familiar? With this extention you can easily
   switch back to the previous tab you were viewing, maintaining your workflow
   without a hitch.
2. Or imagine you're reading an article in a foreign language on Tab A and
   using a dictionary on Tab B. This extension allows you to easily toggle back
   and forth between the two tabs.
